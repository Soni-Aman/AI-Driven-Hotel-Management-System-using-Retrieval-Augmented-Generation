The narrative describes guest interaction, technical issues, staff responses, and emotional impact. It is intentionally lengthy for RAG/document retrieval testing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Day 1 – Arrival Experience**\\n\\nI checked into Room 204 on a hot summer afternoon at around 3:30 PM. The lobby temperature felt perfectly cool, so I assumed the guest rooms would be the same. However, when I opened the door to Room 204, a wave of warm, stuffy air hit my face. The room temperature felt well above 30°C (86°F). The air conditioning unit was already running, but it blew nothing except warm, humid air.\\n\\nAt first, I thought maybe the room simply needed time to cool down. I left my luggage by the bed, placed a bottle of water near the window, and unpacked slowly, waiting for the room to cool. After about an hour, I realized nothing was improving. In fact, the temperature seemed to increase. Sweat rolled down my back and neck, and the air felt thick, stale, and suffocating.\\n\\nI checked the digital thermostat, which showed an error code: **E4 – low gas pressure/coil malfunction**. The AC made a rattling noise every few minutes, followed by a grinding vibration that shook the TV cabinet. Clearly something was wrong.\\n\\nI went downstairs to report the issue at reception. The staff member on duty, named Elena, seemed polite but overwhelmed. She confirmed that engineering staff were “very busy” and told me to wait “just a short while.”\\n\\nAfter returning to my room, the heat was unbearable. My shirt was soaked, and the balcony door would not open properly. I called reception again an hour later, and Elena apologised but said the maintenance team had not yet reached my room. Before sleeping, I requested a different room, but the receptionist insisted the hotel was fully booked.\\n\\nThat first night was miserable. The heat made resting impossible. I tossed and turned, constantly wiping sweat off my forehead. The ceiling fan rattled loudly, offering little relief. By morning, I had barely slept an hour.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Day 2 – Broken Promises and Staff Miscommunication**\\n\\nAt 7:00 AM, I walked back to the front desk to repeat my complaint. A different staff member, Victor, acted surprised and said there was no record of my complaint the previous day, which made me frustrated. He told me he would “personally handle it” and asked me to wait in the room until a technician arrived.\\n\\nI skipped breakfast, afraid to miss the maintenance visit. No one arrived. At 11:00 AM, I called again, and reception claimed the technician would come “right after lunch.”\\n\\nAfternoon arrived. Still no technician.\\n\\nAround 3:00 PM, I decided to visit guest relations in person. They told me the technician had gone to Room 304 by mistake, thinking that was the complaint room. They apologised and said someone was “on the way.”\\n\\nFinally, at around 4:00 PM, a maintenance worker entered the room. He inspected the unit, removed the front panel, and immediately said, “This is bad. The internal compressor is overheated.” He turned off the unit completely and said it needed replacement. He estimated repairs would finish in one hour.\\n\\nI was relieved. Maybe I could finally cool down.\\n\\nHowever, the technician never returned.\\n\\nAt 6 PM, I went downstairs again, exhausted. The staff told me repairs were delayed and the technician had left for the day. They offered a small desk fan as compensation, which barely helped.\\n\\nAnother sleepless night followed. The temperature stayed dangerously high. The lack of ventilation made it even worse. I drank multiple bottles of water to avoid dehydration, but I still woke up dizzy and nauseous several times.\\n\\nThe AC unit continued to click, beep, and make random bursting sounds. I unplugged it, afraid it might catch fire.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Day 3 – Health Impact and Guest Anger**\\n\\nBy the morning of Day 3, frustration turned into anger. I walked downstairs again to demand resolution. I was sweating through my shirt just standing in the elevator.\\n\\nI told the front desk I wanted to check out early due to extreme discomfort. Instead of apologizing, the employee frowned and said early checkout would incur full charges and penalties. It felt like the hotel cared more about money than guest welfare.\\n\\nI explained I had a headache, dry eyes, and dizziness from lack of sleep and heat exposure. No one offered medical help or even a bottle of water.\\n\\nAround noon, the hotel manager finally spoke to me. He claimed the AC compressors across multiple rooms were failing and that engineers were working overtime. He offered me lunch vouchers and said he would “try” to find an empty room if one became available.\\n\\nAfter lunch, the situation worsened. The desk fan they gave me suddenly stopped working. My phone overheated when I tried charging it. Even water bottles stored in the room turned warm.\\n\\nAt 2:20 PM, I asked to visit Room 204 with a temperature scanner. The device showed **31.8°C (89.2°F)** inside the room—nearly outside safe sleeping levels.\\n\\nOther guests on the same floor complained loudly near the elevator. I heard someone yell that Room 206 and Room 209 had AC units that also failed. The hotel seemed to be experiencing a major cooling system crisis.\\n\\nThat night, I slept on a towel over the floor near the door for the slightly cooler air leaking through the hallway gap. I barely got any sleep at all.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Staff Attitude**\\n\\nThroughout the stay, what upset me most was not just the failed AC—it was the staff attitude and communication failure:\\n\\n1. Promises made, then ignored\\n2. Repair team lost or misdirected\\n3. No empathy\\n4. No urgency\\n5. No temporary room offered\\n6. Records not maintained correctly\\n7. Excessive waiting time\\n8. Dismissive tone from certain employees\\n\\nInstead of acknowledging fault, several staff members behaved defensively. One receptionist rolled her eyes when I explained the heat problem for the fourth time. Another tried to suggest I was exaggerating, even though I offered thermometer readings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Technical AC Analysis (Provided by Maintenance Worker)**\\n\\nThe maintenance worker mentioned the following technical observations:\\n\\n* Low refrigerant level\\n* Broken compressor system\\n* Coil obstruction\\n* Faulty fan motor\\n* Condenser rust\\n* Gas leakage\\n* Temperature sensor malfunction\\n\\nHe also said the AC unit was “over 15 years old and never fully replaced.”\\n\\nIf that is true, then the hotel should not rent out this room at all.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Financial Losses and Travel Impact**\\n\\nMy stay at this hotel was business-related. Because of the heat, I:\\n\\n* Could not prepare a presentation\\n* Missed two morning meetings\\n* Lost professional productivity\\n* Slept almost zero hours\\n* Ruined my daily schedule\\n\\nThese consequences are significant. A hotel room should never cause this level of damage to a guest’s responsibilities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Guest Departure Summary**\\n\\nOn the fourth morning, I checked out. Even then, staff insisted on charging every night at full rate, including service fees. I was stunned. I requested at least partial refund, but they denied it.\\n\\nThey did not take responsibility for the AC failure, nor did they provide an incident report document.\\n\\nI left exhausted, sweating, angry, and deeply disappointed. Hotel Sunrise Coastal Resort in Room 204 is the worst hotel room experience I have had in years.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Closing Reflection (Long Section for Testing)**\\n\\nNo guest should have to endure extreme heat conditions in a hotel room, especially when paying premium rates. The hotel failed in four critical ways:\\n\\n1. **Technical Maintenance Failure** – Equipment clearly old and unsafe.\\n2. **Communication Breakdown** – Staff poorly trained and misinformed.\\n3. **Health Negligence** – Heat levels reached unsafe numbers.\\n4. **Financial Exploitation** – Full charges despite service collapse.\\n\\nI had imagined a restful stay, peaceful sleep, cold drinks, quiet evenings, and a refreshing environment. Instead, the room became an oven.\\n\\nThis incident will strongly influence future travel decisions. I will warn colleagues and friends. No marketing campaign or discount could convince me to return.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **End of File – 1,200+ words**\\n\\n---\\n\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\airport_pickup.txt'}, page_content='\\n\\n\\nAirport pickup services are important for travelers who want a safe, stress-free arrival experience. This text document is intentionally long to support machine learning experiments, particularly vector embedding pipelines and document retrieval systems. It covers procedures, airport etiquette, ground transportation, rideshare services, luggage handling, hotel coordination, VIP traveler care, safety precautions, emergency planning, and customer communication guidelines. Even though this document discusses real-world airport pickup details, it is for testing only and may not represent actual airport policy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 1 – INTRODUCTION TO AIRPORT PICKUP**\\n\\nAirport pickup refers to the process of receiving a traveler when they arrive at an airport and transporting them to a hotel or destination. This service is commonly used by tourists, business professionals, family members, corporate employees, students, conference speakers, and event guests.\\n\\nThe goal is simple: ensure that travelers reach their destination comfortably. Pickup instructions must be clear because airports can be stressful environments. They are often loud, crowded, confusing, and fast-moving. Travelers may be tired from long flights, jet-lagged, dehydrated, or unfamiliar with airport signs. This is why detailed guidance helps avoid mistakes and delays.\\n\\nAirport pickup operations involve:\\n\\n* communication with the traveler\\n* correct vehicle assignment\\n* monitoring flight arrival time\\n* holding signage\\n* safe luggage handling\\n* confirming passenger identity\\n* transportation management\\n* hotel coordination\\n* customer service training\\n\\nThis file includes step-by-step guidelines so an AI retrieval system can extract meaningful answers to user queries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 2 – BEFORE ARRIVAL PROCEDURES**\\n\\nBefore the traveler lands, preparation begins. The pickup coordinator checks the flight schedule, monitors real-time delays, and verifies terminal changes. Many airports update arrival gates at the last minute, so staff must remain alert.\\n\\nCommunication with a traveler starts 24 hours earlier. A message might include:\\n\\n* driver name\\n* vehicle model and color\\n* license plate number\\n* pickup location\\n* emergency contact number\\n* instructions for baggage claim\\n* airport map attachment\\n\\nThis step builds trust and reduces confusion.\\n\\nFlight monitoring is important. Airlines sometimes land earlier than estimated time, especially overnight flights. The pickup team should arrive at least 30 minutes before the landing time to avoid leaving a guest waiting.\\n\\nStaff should wear professional clothing, keep phones charged, and prepare physical or digital signs containing the guest’s name.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 3 – ARRIVAL AND MEETING POINTS**\\n\\nAirports are divided into zones: terminals, gates, customs, immigration, and baggage claim areas. These locations vary based on international or domestic arrivals. Pickup workers must stand at the correct meeting spot.\\n\\nMost common meeting areas include:\\n\\n* arrival hall exit\\n* luggage claim conveyor\\n* outside taxi lane\\n* designated ride-share stop\\n* hotel shuttle bus zone\\n* airport welcome center\\n\\nTravelers may get lost, so instructions must be simple. Pickup signs should be bold, printed clearly, and held at chest height. Spelling accuracy matters—misspelled names delay connection.\\n\\nIf the traveler cannot find the driver, a backup communication plan must be used. This may include texting GPS location pins, sending photos of the meeting point, or reopening the phone line.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 4 – LUGGAGE HANDLING PROCEDURES**\\n\\nOnce the driver meets the traveler, the next task is handling luggage. Some passengers carry heavy bags, fragile items, sports gear, pets, strollers, or oversized suitcases. Drivers must treat belongings with care.\\n\\nGuidelines include:\\n\\n* lift with knees, not back\\n* do not drag bags on airport floor\\n* check bag count before leaving area\\n* secure suitcases properly in trunk\\n* keep valuables inside with passenger\\n\\nDrivers should ask permission before touching bags to avoid misunderstanding. Some cultures consider personal items private.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 5 – VEHICLE SELECTION AND ROUTE PLANNING**\\n\\nChoosing the correct vehicle is important. Luxury sedans may be used for executives, large vans for families, minibuses for tour groups, and SUVs for rough terrain or winter conditions.\\n\\nDrivers must confirm:\\n\\n* seatbelts working\\n* air conditioning functioning\\n* vehicle cleanliness\\n* fuel level sufficient\\n\\nRoute planning requires checking GPS for traffic conditions. Accidents, construction, parades, and weather delays can change travel time. The goal is to reach the hotel efficiently and safely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 6 – COMMUNICATION ETIQUETTE**\\n\\nAirport pickup involves communication at multiple stages: before arrival, during pickup, and after drop-off. Polite language, patience, and empathy matter.\\n\\nTravelers may be anxious or exhausted. Drivers should speak clearly:\\n\\n* “Welcome to the city!”\\n* “How was your flight?”\\n* “Do you have everything you need?”\\n\\nAvoid intrusive or personal questions.\\n\\nDrivers should also confirm destination address verbally to prevent mistakes. Hotels often have similar names, so repeating details helps avoid wrong drop-offs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 7 – SAFETY AND SECURITY MEASURES**\\n\\nSafety is the highest priority. Drivers must never leave their vehicle unattended in illegal parking lanes. They must obey airport traffic rules.\\n\\nPassenger identity must be confirmed to prevent fraud. Drivers check the traveler’s name and match it to the sign.\\n\\nSeatbelts are mandatory. Children require booster or infant seats. Drivers must avoid speeding, harsh braking, or distraction while driving.\\n\\nWeather conditions like heavy rain, fog, snow, or strong winds demand slower speed.\\n\\nSecurity also includes personal safety. Travelers should store passports and electronics securely. Drivers should avoid discussing political opinions, religious topics, or confidential travel plans.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 8 – SPECIAL NEEDS SUPPORT**\\n\\nSome travelers require additional help. Wheelchair passengers need accessible vehicles with ramps. Elderly guests may walk slowly and need support carrying items. Families with infants may require stops for feeding.\\n\\nMedical support may include:\\n\\n* medication reminders\\n* oxygen tank storage\\n* emergency hospital route planning\\n\\nDrivers must remain respectful and never rush guests.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 9 – VIP ARRIVAL EXPERIENCE**\\n\\nVIP airport pickup services include luxury features such as:\\n\\n* business class lounge greeting\\n* personal concierge\\n* premium vehicles\\n* bottled water\\n* phone chargers\\n* silent cabin environment\\n* express baggage retrieval\\n\\nExecutives, performers, athletes, diplomats, and keynote speakers often receive this service.\\n\\nThe goal is to create a memorable arrival. Staff may handle hotel check-in remotely to save time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 10 – DELAYS & PROBLEM RESOLUTION**\\n\\nSometimes flights are delayed, rescheduled, or canceled. Pickup staff must adapt.\\n\\nProblems that might occur:\\n\\n* traveler lost phone\\n* wrong terminal arrival\\n* missing luggage\\n* flight customs delay\\n* airport lockdown\\n* language barriers\\n\\nA calm response prevents frustration. Drivers must remain available for extra time if needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 11 – HOTEL COORDINATION**\\n\\nHotels often partner with airport pickup services. Reservation teams share arrival times, guest names, and luggage count. Hotel staff prepare rooms, adjust check-in timing, and communicate traveler needs.\\n\\nSome hotels offer:\\n\\n* free shuttle buses\\n* private transfer upgrades\\n* multilingual support\\n* local tourism brochures\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 12 – RIDESHARE & TAXI SYSTEMS**\\n\\nAirports operate designated pick-up lanes for rideshare services such as Uber, Lyft, Didi, Ola, and Grab. Taxi stands are separate, and pricing structures vary. Some airports require digital permits for commercial pickup vehicles.\\n\\nDrivers must understand these rules or risk fines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 13 – PASSENGER FEEDBACK PROCESS**\\n\\nAfter drop-off, travelers submit reviews. Feedback covers:\\n\\n* punctuality\\n* vehicle cleanliness\\n* driving quality\\n* politeness\\n* luggage care\\n* professionalism\\n\\nPositive service builds reputation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 14 – TESTING USE FOR RAG SYSTEMS**\\n\\nThis file supports AI testing such as:\\n\\n* splitting into 500-character chunks\\n* embedding sentences\\n* building retrieval datasets\\n* similarity search evaluation\\n* multi-document comparison\\n\\nSuggested queries include:\\n\\n* “Where should a driver wait in the airport?”\\n* “How to handle damaged luggage?”\\n* “Explain hotel coordination role.”\\n\\nThis style helps test vector databases like ChromaDB or Pinecone.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 15 – EXTRA CONTENT FOR WORD COUNT**\\n\\nAirport environments vary everywhere in the world. Some are small regional terminals with minimal security, while others are international hubs serving millions. Dubai, Atlanta, Singapore, Qatar, and Heathrow airports represent some of the busiest operations. Taxi lines may stretch long distances. Public train stations connect travelers to city centers. Buses run on schedule. Shuttle services operate twenty-four hours. Airport noise includes announcements, people speaking multiple languages, rolling suitcases, children crying, and jet engines. The smell of coffee, fuel, and perfume fills the air. Each airport has unique culture, layout, and passenger flow patterns.\\n\\nNoise and fatigue influence traveler reactions. A friendly greeting can change their entire experience. Professional drivers understand human psychology as well as navigation. Helping a tired customer carry heavy luggage sends a message of respect.\\n\\nIn some countries, tipping drivers is common. In others, tipping may be rude. Cultural sensitivity prevents awkward moments.\\n\\nAirport pickup is not just transportation—it is a welcoming introduction to a city.\\n\\n---\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\allergy_information.txt'}, page_content='\\n\\n\\nFood allergies are increasingly common across the world. Many people experience allergic reactions when their immune system incorrectly identifies harmless ingredients as dangerous invaders. This document is intentionally written to be long, descriptive, and rich in real-world examples. It can be used for document chunking, retrieval-augmented generation projects, vector embedding tests, sentence similarity matching, or database indexing. Although this file discusses food safety information, it is not medical advice; it is simply a structured dataset for testing your AI pipeline.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 1 – WHAT ARE FOOD ALLERGIES?**\\n\\nFood allergies occur when the immune system reacts to proteins in food. Instead of processing these proteins normally, the body produces antibodies that trigger reactions ranging from mild to life-threatening. These reactions may include hives, itching, swelling, sneezing, coughing, vomiting, stomach cramps, or difficulty breathing. In many cases, allergic reactions happen within seconds or minutes of exposure. In rare cases, symptoms can appear hours later.\\n\\nMillions of people rely on safe ingredient labeling to avoid allergy triggers. Restaurants must follow strict regulations to separate allergenic foods from non-allergenic foods. This requires constant cleaning, correct cooking procedures, proper food storage, separate cutting boards, and employee training.\\n\\nThis document explores the most common allergens: peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, gluten, eggs, soy, sesame, seafood, sulfites, and artificial food additives. We also discuss cross-contamination, sensitivity versus intolerance, and best practices for safe dining.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 2 – PEANUT ALLERGIES**\\n\\nPeanut allergies are among the most dangerous food allergies, often leading to severe reactions. Some individuals cannot tolerate even tiny traces of peanut residue on surfaces or in oils. Restaurants must handle peanuts carefully and label menu items clearly. Peanut butter, peanut oil, and crushed peanuts are used in cookies, pastries, Thai dishes, desserts, salad dressings, sauces, noodles, and baked goods.\\n\\nCommon foods containing peanuts:\\n\\n* Peanut butter spreads\\n* Peanut sauces in Asian cuisine\\n* Peanut flour in baked pastries\\n* Chocolate bars\\n* Granola mixes\\n* Ice cream flavors\\n\\nCross-contamination occurs when peanut products touch other foods. For example, using the same spoon for almond butter and peanut butter can cause allergic exposure. This is why labeling, storage, and packaging are extremely important.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 3 – TREE NUT ALLERGIES**\\n\\nTree nut allergies include almonds, walnuts, pecans, pistachios, cashews, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts. These nuts are used in baked items like brownies, muffins, and cookies. They also appear in salads, granola, chocolates, ice creams, and gourmet sauces.\\n\\nRestaurants must avoid storing nuts in open containers near non-nut items. Some guests only react to one nut type, while others must avoid all tree nuts for safety. Many bakeries carry risk because nut particles can travel in the air. Good restaurants provide “nut-free” working zones.\\n\\nTree nuts often appear in vegan food as meat substitutes. Cashew cream, almond milk, and walnut tacos are common. Chefs must be aware that nut-based dairy alternatives can trigger allergies just as quickly as other nut products.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 4 – DAIRY ALLERGIES**\\n\\nDairy allergies are different from lactose intolerance. An allergy triggers the immune system, while intolerance affects digestion. People allergic to dairy must avoid milk, butter, yogurt, cheese, whey, and any product containing casein or lactose protein.\\n\\nSymptoms include:\\n\\n* swelling around mouth\\n* coughing\\n* skin rash\\n* stomach pain\\n* shortness of breath\\n\\nRestaurants provide dairy-free options using oat milk, almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk, or rice milk. Many baked goods contain hidden dairy ingredients, making clear labeling important. Butter sauces, whipped toppings, chocolates, and creamy soups often contain dairy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 5 – GLUTEN AND WHEAT ALLERGIES**\\n\\nGluten allergies involve wheat proteins. Many customers experience painful symptoms after eating wheat, including celiac disease sufferers who cannot digest gluten at all. Wheat appears in:\\n\\n* breads\\n* cereals\\n* pizza dough\\n* pasta\\n* cake\\n* cookies\\n* soy sauce\\n* fried foods\\n\\nSome people confuse gluten intolerance with celiac disease, but the severity differs. Restaurants must keep separate gluten-free spaces, clean knives, and use dedicated cutting boards. Staff training prevents flour dust contamination during baking.\\n\\nGluten-free items may include rice noodles, corn tortillas, chickpea pasta, and quinoa bowls. Customers rely on restaurants to label gluten clearly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 6 – EGG ALLERGIES**\\n\\nEgg allergies are common in children. Eggs appear in baked goods, mayonnaise, cakes, pastries, pancakes, French toast, pasta, salad dressings, certain sauces, and even alcoholic drinks that use egg whites.\\n\\nEgg substitutes include aquafaba, tofu puree, banana mash, applesauce, or chia seed gel. Restaurants offering egg-free menus must avoid shared frying oil, because frying chicken tenders and French fries in the same oil can transfer egg particles.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 7 – SOY ALLERGIES**\\n\\nSoy is used widely in processed foods:\\n\\n* tofu\\n* miso\\n* tempeh\\n* soy oil\\n* soy lecithin\\n* soy milk\\n* plant-based burgers\\n\\nMany people don’t realize, but soy lecithin is present in chocolate bars, baked goods, and snacks. Menu designers must list soy-related ingredients clearly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 8 – SESAME ALLERGIES**\\n\\nSesame allergies are increasing globally. Sesame seeds appear on burger buns, sushi rolls, falafel, crackers, breads, and Middle-Eastern plates. Sesame oil is used in Asian cooking, making labeling critical. Customers often ask restaurants to remove sesame toppings for safety.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 9 – SEAFOOD AND SHELLFISH ALLERGIES**\\n\\nShellfish allergies include shrimp, crab, lobster, oysters, scallops, mussels, and clams. Cooking vapors can trigger airborne reactions. Fish allergies differ; people may be allergic to salmon but not shrimp. Seafood restaurants require extreme caution with shared fryers and grills.\\n\\nCross-contact risks include:\\n\\n* shared fryers\\n* shared knives\\n* steam from boiling pots\\n* shared cutting boards\\n\\nRestaurants should separate seafood cooking zones.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 10 – SULFITES & ADDITIVE ALLERGIES**\\n\\nSulfites are preservatives found in wine, dried fruit, frozen potatoes, soda drinks, and packaged snacks. Some customers experience headaches, asthma attacks, or stomach pain. Artificial colorants and chemical additives can trigger allergies as well.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 11 – CROSS-CONTAMINATION EXPLAINED**\\n\\nCross-contamination means allergens transfer from one food to another. Examples include:\\n\\n* using the same knife for peanut cake and chocolate cake\\n* storing wheat bread next to gluten-free bread\\n* frying fish and fries in the same oil\\n* scooping ice cream with shared utensils\\n\\nRestaurants must clean surfaces properly, wash hands frequently, and maintain separate prep spaces. Good allergy systems separate allergen-free items with color-coded equipment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 12 – SENSITIVITY VS ALLERGY**\\n\\nFood sensitivity causes discomfort, but allergies can cause severe reactions. For example, some people have lactose intolerance but not dairy allergy. Sensitivity rarely causes anaphylaxis, while allergies can be fatal. This difference must be recognized in menu planning and medical response training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 13 – EMERGENCY RESPONSE FACTS**\\n\\nIf someone has a severe reaction:\\n\\n* call emergency services\\n* administer epinephrine injection if available\\n* avoid forcing liquids\\n* remain calm\\n* monitor breathing\\n* never assume symptoms will go away on their own\\n\\nRestaurants should train staff in EpiPen use and CPR.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 14 – FINAL NOTES FOR TESTING PURPOSES**\\n\\nThis file is designed for computer analysis. Its length allows interesting experiments such as:\\n\\n* splitting text into chunks of 500 characters\\n* storing each chunk in a vector database\\n* embedding with models like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\\n* retrieving sections based on queries like:\\n  “What foods contain peanuts?”\\n  “Explain gluten-free safety rules.”\\n  “Which allergens are common in dairy products?”\\n\\nThe patterns, repetitions, and structured headings help evaluate whether the retrieval system returns correct matches.\\n\\nThis text also purposely includes educational formatting, repeated allergen names, descriptive sentences, and rich vocabulary. That ensures embeddings capture relationships between sections.\\n\\nIf you want to use this file to test metadata tagging, try highlighting categories like:\\n\\n* allergen name\\n* food group\\n* safety instructions\\n* medical notes\\n* example ingredients\\n\\nThese tags help machine learning systems organize and filter stored embeddings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\booking_com_reviews.txt'}, page_content='\\n\\n**Booking.com Guest Reviews – Hotel Sunrise Coastal Resort**\\n\\nBelow you’ll find a large collection of guest review samples structured in various lengths and tones. These reviews include praises, complaints, opinions about amenities, suggestions, and overall user impressions. They are fictional and generated for testing a RAG system or vector database workflow.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #1 – Excellent Stay (5/5 Rating)**\\n\\nI stayed at Hotel Sunrise for five nights in early September, and it was one of the most pleasant hotel experiences I’ve had in years. From the moment I stepped through the doors, the staff greeted me warmly and professionally. My check-in process took less than five minutes. The lobby smelled fresh and had a bright, modern design. My room was on the sixth floor facing the sea, and the view was just incredible: quiet waves early in the morning, sunset colors at night, and that refreshing ocean breeze every time I opened the balcony door.\\n\\nHousekeeping did a great job throughout the stay. Towels were replaced daily, linens felt clean and soft, and the bathroom was spotless. The shower pressure was perfect too, and the toiletries were surprisingly luxurious. I especially loved the breakfast buffet; there were pastries, fresh fruit, an omelet station, customized coffee orders, and gluten-free bread options.\\n\\nI also appreciated the spa and gym facilities. The indoor pool was warm and peaceful; I spent at least an hour there every evening. Staff in the spa area were polite and attentive without being intrusive.\\n\\nOne final compliment: the Wi-Fi was great—fast enough for video calls and streaming. I worked remotely during my stay and had zero connectivity issues. Highly recommended. I will definitely return!\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #2 – Good Location, Slow Service (3/5 Rating)**\\n\\nThe hotel sits right in the city center, which makes it extremely convenient for walking around. We barely touched public transportation, because cafés, shops, and bus stops were within minutes. The room itself was okay, although the furniture looked a little old and scratched. The mattress felt moderately comfortable, but the pillows were too soft, and I woke up with neck pain each morning.\\n\\nWhat really disappointed me was the service speed. We waited nearly twenty minutes at the front desk to check in because there was only one staff member working. Later in the evening, when requesting extra towels, we had to call three times before someone brought them up.\\n\\nBreakfast selection was decent but repetitive. After the third morning, we got tired of the same menu. Still, I cannot complain about cleanliness; our bathroom was tidy, and the carpets were freshly vacuumed. Overall, it wasn’t bad, but it didn’t feel impressive either.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #3 – Terrible Experience (1/5 Rating)**\\n\\nI rarely leave reviews, but this place deserves one. Everything from start to finish was exhausting and inconvenient. My room was not ready when I arrived, even though check-in officially began an hour earlier. The woman at the front desk did not apologize and told me to wait in the lobby. I waited forty minutes before receiving a key.\\n\\nWhen I finally reached the room, the sheets were stained, the phone didn’t work, and the desk lamp flickered constantly. I reported the issues immediately, but no one came for hours. I ended up cleaning the room myself using wipes I had in my luggage.\\n\\nThe walls in the building are paper thin—you can hear conversations in the adjacent rooms and footsteps from the hallway. Sleeping here was impossible. I tried to ask for a refund and early check-out, but the staff refused, saying that “no other rooms were available.”\\n\\nI regret booking this hotel. Avoid if you want peace, comfort, or professionalism.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #4 – Family Vacation Success (5/5 Rating)**\\n\\nWe brought our whole family for a week-long summer trip, including grandparents and two kids. The resort exceeded expectations. The staff were incredibly patient with my children, helping them choose desserts at dinner and showing them card tricks. The pools were spectacular—huge outdoor pools with plenty of seating, plus multiple waterslides. Safety supervisors were present the whole time, which helped us relax.\\n\\nOur rooms were adjoining and spacious. The beds were huge, and the windows provided a beautiful view of palm trees. The cleaning service provided fresh towels twice a day and chocolate for the kids each night.\\n\\nThe food quality was outstanding. There were themed buffet nights, ranging from Mediterranean cuisine to Asian fusion. The pizza station was a family favorite, and dessert options were ridiculous—cakes, ice cream, whipped cream trays, cheesecake, and fruit tarts.\\n\\nOverall, the trip felt magical. I would recommend Hotel Sunrise to any family looking to create memories together.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #5 – Business Traveler Thoughts (4/5 Rating)**\\n\\nAs someone who travels constantly for work, I evaluate hotels based on quiet workspace, desk comfort, Wi-Fi dependability, and late-night food availability. Hotel Sunrise did extremely well in most categories. The chair in my room was ergonomic, the desk large enough for two laptops, and the internet stayed consistently fast.\\n\\nNoise control was good, although I could occasionally hear hallway footsteps. Room service functioned efficiently; I ordered soup at 1 AM and received it within 20 minutes. Breakfast at the restaurant included solid espresso, which is rare. I only deducted one star because bathroom ventilation was poor, causing the mirrors to fog up for a long time.\\n\\nI would stay again and recommend it to coworkers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #6 – Wedding Event Stay (5/5 Rating)**\\n\\nWe hosted our daughter’s wedding reception at the hotel ballroom and booked twenty rooms for family and friends. Everything was coordinated perfectly. The banquet hall decorations looked elegant; staff set up floral arrangements, candles, and chairs exactly as we imagined. The wedding buffet included carving stations, a chocolate fountain, and a mix of vegetarian and meat dishes.\\n\\nAll our guests said their rooms were comfortable, and the staff accommodated early check-ins without complaint. The bar remained open later than usual to serve our group. We are extremely satisfied with the experience and grateful to the hotel team for making the wedding day memorable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #7 – Long-Term Stay Review (4/5 Rating)**\\n\\nI lived at Hotel Sunrise for one full month while completing remote research work. Long stays can reveal many hidden flaws, but I am glad to report mostly positive impressions. Gym equipment was updated weekly, housekeeping cleaned thoroughly, and I received package deliveries without problems.\\n\\nOccasionally, the elevators were slow, and the air conditioning made a humming noise. Still, these issues never affected my ability to work or relax. Staff members addressed requests respectfully and remembered my name. This personal touch made my stay meaningful.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #8 – Neutral Feedback (3/5 Rating)**\\n\\nHotel Sunrise isn’t terrible, but it isn’t extraordinary either. The paint in the hallways looked worn, some carpets near elevators smelled of humidity, and the pool deck furniture had stains.\\n\\nThe front desk staff were friendly, and check-in was smooth, but nighttime service was limited. We tried room service at 11:30 PM and were informed that the kitchen closes early.\\n\\nBreakfast was tasty, especially the waffles and fruit bowls, but coffee quality varied from day to day.\\n\\nWould I return? Maybe—but only if I needed to stay near the beach again.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #9 – Reviewer Focus on Parking (4/5 Rating)**\\n\\nThe parking garage was convenient and straightforward. I didn’t need to fight for a spot, and the spacing was wide enough for my truck. The only downside was the ramp being narrow; I nearly scraped the wall entering Level 2. Otherwise, everything felt safe.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Review #10 – Food Critic Style Review (5/5 Rating)**\\n\\nIf you enjoy food, stay here. Breakfast: spectacular. Lunch: diverse. Dinner: outstanding. It isn’t cheap, but the quality justifies the cost.\\n\\nThe seafood buffet offered buttery shrimp, tuna steaks, salmon, and clams. Desserts tasted heavenly. Staff constantly replenished trays, and nothing ever looked stale.\\n\\nI booked this hotel for an anniversary trip and would do so again without hesitation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*(The document continues with mixed reviews, stylistic variations, different tones, expanded detail sections, and closing reflection paragraphs to exceed 1000 words.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\child_policy.txt'}, page_content='\\n\\nThis document explains the child policy followed in hotel management operations. A child policy defines the rules related to the stay, accommodation, meals, safety, and services provided to children staying at a hotel. A clear child policy helps hotels manage capacity, pricing, safety, and guest expectations while ensuring comfort for families.\\n\\nIn hotel management, a child is usually defined based on age limits set by the hotel. Commonly, children below the age of 5 or 6 years are considered infants, while children between 6 and 12 years are classified as children. Guests above the specified age limit are treated as adults for pricing and occupancy purposes. These age brackets may vary depending on hotel category and location.\\n\\nChild accommodation policies specify whether children can stay free of charge. Many hotels allow children up to a certain age to stay free when sharing existing bedding with parents or guardians. No extra bed is provided in such cases. This policy encourages family travel and improves guest satisfaction.\\n\\nExtra bed policies apply when an additional bed is required for a child. Hotels may provide an extra bed or rollaway bed at an additional cost. The availability of extra beds depends on room size, hotel occupancy, and safety regulations. Charges for extra beds are usually lower for children than for adults.\\n\\nMaximum occupancy rules must be followed at all times. Each room has a defined maximum number of adults and children allowed. Exceeding this limit is not permitted due to safety, fire regulations, and comfort standards. Hotel staff must ensure that child accommodation does not violate occupancy limits.\\n\\nMeal policies for children vary across hotels. Some hotels offer complimentary meals for children below a specific age when dining with parents. Others provide children’s menus at discounted rates. Breakfast policies may allow children to eat free if included in the parent’s meal plan.\\n\\nChild pricing is an important part of hotel revenue management. Hotels may charge a reduced rate for children staying in the room with parents. This rate may include accommodation only or accommodation with meals, depending on the package selected during booking.\\n\\nSafety and supervision policies are critical when children are present. Hotels require that children be supervised by parents or guardians at all times, especially in public areas such as swimming pools, gyms, elevators, and play zones. The hotel is not responsible for unsupervised children.\\n\\nSwimming pool usage by children is governed by strict rules. Children are usually allowed to use the pool only under adult supervision. Some hotels specify age restrictions, depth limitations, and designated children’s pool areas. Proper swimwear is mandatory for hygiene and safety.\\n\\nChild-friendly facilities enhance the guest experience. Many hotels provide amenities such as cribs, high chairs, baby cots, and play areas upon request. These facilities may be complimentary or chargeable depending on hotel policy and availability.\\n\\nHousekeeping services may offer special arrangements for families with children. This includes additional towels, child-safe room setups, and cleaning schedules convenient for families. Parents are encouraged to inform the hotel in advance about specific child-related requirements.\\n\\nLiability and damage policies apply equally to children. Any damage to hotel property caused by children is the responsibility of the parents or guardians. Hotels may charge repair or replacement costs as per assessment by the management.\\n\\nChild policies also apply to check-in and identification procedures. Parents or guardians must provide valid identification for themselves and the children, if required by local regulations. This ensures compliance with legal and security standards.\\n\\nDuring emergencies, hotels prioritize the safety of children. Parents must follow hotel emergency procedures and evacuation guidelines. Staff are trained to assist families, but primary responsibility remains with guardians.\\n\\nClear communication of child policy is essential. The policy should be mentioned on the hotel website, booking platforms, and confirmation emails. Front office staff must explain child-related charges and facilities during check-in to avoid misunderstandings.\\n\\nA well-structured child policy supports smooth hotel operations and enhances family guest satisfaction. It balances comfort, safety, and operational efficiency while meeting legal and business requirements.\\n\\n'),\n",

Housekeeping SOPs ensure cleanliness, hygiene, safety, and comfort for guests while maintaining consistent service quality across the hotel.\\n\\nThe housekeeping department is responsible for maintaining guest rooms, public areas, back-of-house areas, and laundry services. Cleanliness directly impacts guest satisfaction and the hotel’s brand image. All housekeeping staff must strictly follow defined procedures and safety standards.\\n\\nDaily room cleaning procedures begin with checking the room status through the front office or property management system. Housekeepers must confirm whether the room is vacant, occupied, or due for check-out before entering. Proper authorization ensures guest privacy and security.\\n\\nBefore entering a guest room, staff must knock, announce “Housekeeping,” and wait for a response. If no response is received, the announcement should be repeated before entering. This procedure prevents guest disturbance and maintains professionalism.\\n\\nRoom cleaning starts with ventilation by opening windows or adjusting air circulation if permitted. Used linen, towels, and waste must be collected and placed in designated bags. Trash bins are emptied and sanitized to maintain hygiene.\\n\\nBed-making procedures include replacing used bed linen, checking mattress protectors, and ensuring beds are neatly arranged. Linen must be free from stains, odors, or damage. Beds should be made according to hotel standards with proper alignment and presentation.\\n\\nBathroom cleaning is a critical part of housekeeping SOPs. Toilets, washbasins, showers, and bathtubs must be cleaned using approved disinfectants. Fixtures are wiped dry to prevent water marks. Toiletries are replenished as per room category standards.\\n\\nRoom surfaces such as tables, desks, wardrobes, and shelves must be dusted and sanitized. Electronic items like remote controls, telephones, and switches should be cleaned carefully. Floors are vacuumed or mopped depending on surface type.\\n\\nAmenity replenishment includes checking and refilling items such as drinking water, tea and coffee supplies, stationery, and guest information folders. All amenities must match the room inventory checklist.\\n\\nCheck-out room procedures involve more detailed cleaning and inspection. Minibar consumption is recorded, lost and found items are reported, and maintenance issues are logged. Rooms are released only after final inspection by a supervisor.\\n\\nPublic area cleaning SOPs cover lobbies, corridors, elevators, restrooms, restaurants, and meeting rooms. These areas require frequent cleaning due to high foot traffic. Cleaning schedules are planned to minimize guest inconvenience.\\n\\nLaundry and linen handling procedures ensure hygiene and efficiency. Soiled linen must be separated, labeled, and sent to the laundry area. Clean linen is stored in designated areas and handled with care to avoid contamination.\\n\\nUse of cleaning chemicals must follow safety guidelines. Staff should wear protective equipment such as gloves and masks when required. Chemicals must be labeled and stored securely to prevent misuse or accidents.\\n\\nHousekeeping staff must report maintenance issues such as faulty lights, plumbing leaks, or damaged furniture immediately. Coordination with the engineering department ensures timely repairs and guest comfort.\\n\\nLost and found SOPs require staff to report any guest belongings found in rooms or public areas. Items must be logged, labeled, and stored securely. Guests are contacted as per hotel policy.\\n\\nPersonal grooming and conduct standards are mandatory. Housekeeping staff must wear clean uniforms, maintain hygiene, and follow professional behavior at all times. Courtesy and discretion are essential while interacting with guests.\\n\\nHealth and safety SOPs include proper waste disposal, fire safety awareness, and emergency response procedures. Staff must be trained to handle accidents, spills, or hazardous materials safely.\\n\\nRegular inspections and audits ensure SOP compliance.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\negative_feedback.txt'}, page_content='\\n\\nBelow is a large collection of fictional negative feedback samples based on hotel/resort experiences. This dataset contains multiple complaint categories: service delay, cleanliness issues, rude staff, bad food, noise, billing problems, room defects, and more. All details are invented for testing machine learning, RAG retrieval, or vector embedding systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #1 – Poor Room Condition**\\n\\nMy stay at this hotel was far below expectations. When I entered the room, the first thing I noticed was the unpleasant, damp smell. It reminded me of basements left closed for years. The carpet near the bathroom door was visibly wet, as if someone mopped and never let it dry. The bed also seemed unclean; the sheets had wrinkles that suggested they were never changed. There were hairs on the pillowcase and stains on the blanket. I immediately requested new linens, but the housekeeping staff took almost three hours to respond.\\n\\nThe furniture looked worn out. The wardrobe door did not close, the bedside drawer had broken handles, and the curtains were torn at the bottom. The worst part was discovering mold on the wall near the air conditioning unit. It was disgusting. The walls showed water damage that looked unhealthy and unsafe. I truly regret booking here, and I will never return.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #2 – Rude Reception Staff & Check-In Issues**\\n\\nCheck-in was a nightmare. The receptionist barely greeted us and seemed annoyed that we arrived. When we asked questions about breakfast timings and pool access, she responded with sarcasm. Instead of helping, she pointed vaguely at a pamphlet and walked away.\\n\\nOn top of that, our reservation was apparently “lost.” Even though we had confirmation emails, the hotel staff insisted we booked incorrectly. We waited 45 minutes at the desk while other guests walked past us and received service immediately. It was humiliating. When we finally got our keys, no apology was offered. Terrible start to a vacation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #3 – Noisy Environment, No Sleep**\\n\\nSleeping was impossible at this hotel. Thin walls allowed every sound to travel: footsteps, loud conversations, doors slamming, people laughing in the hallway, and what sounded like furniture moving upstairs. The noise continued past midnight. The hotel claims to be family-friendly, but children ran up and down the corridors screaming, and no staff intervened.\\n\\nThe rooms facing the street are even worse. Cars honked throughout the night, and motorcycles raced by until dawn. We complained to the receptionist, who shrugged and said, “We can’t control the city streets.” If quiet rest matters to you, avoid this place completely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #4 – Poor Wi-Fi & Network Failure**\\n\\nThis hotel advertises fast Wi-Fi, but the internet barely worked. The signal kept dropping, pages took forever to load, and video calls were impossible. Since I was on a work trip, this caused major problems. I approached three different staff members, but all they said was, “We are working on it.”\\n\\nLater, I discovered that the Wi-Fi routers were old and limited, and the hotel purposely restricted speeds. I ended up going to a café down the street just to send emails. Very disappointing. For business travelers, this hotel is a total waste of time and money.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #5 – Food Poisoning Scare & Dirty Restaurant**\\n\\nThe breakfast buffet was shocking. Food trays were not labeled, many items were cold and dried out, and flies hovered over the fruit section. The scrambled eggs looked greenish, and the smell was worse than a university cafeteria on a bad day. My partner and I both felt sick within hours.\\n\\nUtensils were not clean; knives had fingerprints, and plates were greasy. The water dispenser had floating particles in it. When we complained, the restaurant manager acted defensively and blamed guests for “messing up the serving line.” Completely unprofessional.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #6 – Broken Air Conditioning, No Repair Response**\\n\\nOur room had broken air conditioning. The unit made a grinding noise and blew warm air. The temperature in the room was unbearable, especially at night. We reported the issue three times. Maintenance staff visited once, turned the unit off and on, and said everything was fine. It never worked properly.\\n\\nWe ended up sleeping with the balcony door open. Mosquitoes got in, and the humidity ruined our sleep. For a hotel that charges premium rates, this level of negligence is unacceptable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #7 – Hidden Charges & Billing Disputes**\\n\\nThe hotel added several charges to our bill that were not mentioned during booking. They charged for parking even though their website said parking was free. They also added minibar fees for items we never touched. When we refused to pay, the manager threatened to call security.\\n\\nAt checkout, the billing process took nearly an hour. They printed four different invoices, all showing different totals. Staff were clueless. This hotel thrives on dishonesty.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #8 – Pool Filth & Safety Concerns**\\n\\nThe pool area was disgusting. The tiles were slimy, water looked cloudy, and there was trash floating near the edges. I saw used bandages and a plastic wrapper inside the pool. No lifeguard was present, and families let children run and jump dangerously close to others.\\n\\nThe hotel advertises a “heated pool,” yet the water was freezing. We left after five minutes. Definitely not a relaxing experience.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #9 – Shuttle Service Failure**\\n\\nWe booked airport shuttle service in advance, confirmed two days before arrival, and even received a written schedule. But when we landed, no shuttle arrived. After waiting 40 minutes, we called the hotel. The front desk claimed we were never on their arrival list.\\n\\nPaying for a taxi added extra cost, and the hotel refused reimbursement. This failure ruined the start of our trip.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #10 – Housekeeping Neglect**\\n\\nHousekeeping was inconsistent. One day we received fresh towels, the next day nothing. Trash was not removed daily. Glasses stayed dirty in the room for three days. Toiletries ran out, and nobody replaced them. Sheets looked old and scratchy. The entire room felt neglected.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #11 – Elevator Malfunctions**\\n\\nThe elevator broke three different times during our stay. Guests were stuck inside for minutes at a time. With luggage, taking stairs was exhausting. For elderly guests and those with accessibility needs, this hotel is unsafe.\\n\\nStaff simply told us, “It happens sometimes.” That is not acceptable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #12 – Parking Disorganization**\\n\\nParking is chaotic. Spaces are small, lanes are narrow, and signage is unclear. Cars blocked each other. The hotel charged a high fee for an area that looked like a run-down public lot. Very unprofessional.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #13 – Spa Scam**\\n\\nThe hotel spa promised premium treatments. Instead, rooms smelled like chemicals, towels were damp, and staff appeared untrained. My massage felt rushed and careless. When I asked about certifications, the receptionist became hostile. Total scam.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #14 – Unsafe Neighborhood**\\n\\nThe hotel is in a shady area. We heard shouting outside at night, witnessed a fight in the street, and saw broken bottles along the sidewalk. Security presence inside the hotel felt weak. We never felt safe walking outside.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #15 – False Advertising**\\n\\nThe hotel photos online are misleading. Rooms looked modern and spacious in pictures, but in reality everything was outdated. Curtains were faded, furniture scratched, and bathrooms tiny. The sea view was actually a view of a parking lot.\\n\\nWe felt cheated.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #16 – No Accessibility Support**\\n\\nThe hotel claimed to be wheelchair-accessible, but nearly everything required stairs. Ramps were steep, elevators malfunctioned, and staff did not know how to assist disabled guests. This level of dishonesty is unacceptable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #17 – Laundry Failure**\\n\\nThe laundry service ruined my clothes. Shirts came back with detergent stains, some items shrank, and my jeans smelled like chemicals. The hotel refused responsibility.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #18 – Pest Problems**\\n\\nI saw insects crawling near the bathroom sink and small bugs near the lights. It was disgusting. Clearly, this building needs pest control.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #19 – Terrible Value**\\n\\nPrices were outrageous for what we received. I have stayed in budget hostels cleaner than this. Overrated and overpriced.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Complaint #20 – Overall Disappointment Summary (Long Section)**\\n\\nAfter spending one week at this hotel, I can confidently say it is one of the worst accommodations I have ever experienced. Nearly every basic expectation fell apart. The room was hot, dirty, noisy, uncomfortable, outdated, poorly maintained, and smelled like mold. Staff members were rude, lazy, unresponsive, and sometimes aggressive.\\n\\nThe hotel infrastructure felt neglected for years—paint peeling, broken tiles, rusted metal frames, burned-out light bulbs, carpets torn, hallways smelly, and bathrooms stained.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\overbooking_issue.txt'}, page_content=' \\n\\nThis document contains a detailed fictional narrative describing guest frustration caused by hotel overbooking. It includes guest arrival experiences, communication failures, emotional responses, front desk conflicts, financial impact, and operational flaws. The text is intentionally long to support large–scale NLP testing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Introduction**\\n\\nOverbooking occurs when a hotel sells more rooms than are physically available. Although the strategy is used to maximize occupancy, it can cause serious disruption, anxiety, anger, and financial burden for customers when not handled correctly.\\n\\nThe following incident describes how a couple arriving at Hotel Sunrise Coastal Resort on a Friday evening experienced one of the worst hotel check-in events imaginable. The purpose of this file is to simulate a real world complaint for machine learning demonstration. All names, events, and situations are fictional.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Arrival Experience**\\n\\nWe arrived at the hotel after a long nine-hour road trip. My partner and I were exhausted but excited because this stay was supposed to celebrate our anniversary. We booked a luxury suite two months in advance, requested a sea view, and paid extra for early check-in privileges.\\n\\nThe lobby was busy, more crowded than expected, but we approached the reception desk with our confirmation number and ID ready. The receptionist greeted the couple in front of us with polite smiles, so we assumed service quality would match the hotel’s five-star rating.\\n\\nHowever, things changed the moment the receptionist, a young woman named “Kara,” looked at her computer screen and frowned. The first words she said to us were:\\n\\n> “I’m sorry, but there seems to be an issue with your reservation.”\\n\\nMy heart dropped immediately.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Discovery of Overbooking**\\n\\nWe handed her all documents, confident nothing was wrong. She typed for several minutes, whispered to a coworker, then disappeared into the back office. We waited almost fifteen minutes standing at the front desk. Other arriving guests stared at us silently, likely wondering what the problem was.\\n\\nWhen Kara returned, she explained:\\n\\n> “It appears our system overbooked the suite category you reserved. We do not have the room available anymore.”\\n\\nHer tone was emotionless, as if this kind of disaster happened every day.\\n\\nWe demanded clarification. How could a hotel confirm a booking, accept full advance payment, send us arrival reminders, and then claim the room didn’t exist?\\n\\nKara responded with the same rehearsed line:\\n\\n> “The hotel is at full capacity. We are sorry for the inconvenience.”\\n\\nInconvenience? It was much worse than that.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Staff Response and Lack of Accountability**\\n\\nWe asked if a manager could speak with us, and a man named “Daniel” appeared. He apologized, but his apology sounded insincere and rushed. He admitted, without hesitation, that the hotel intentionally sells more rooms than are physically available, expecting some guests to cancel.\\n\\nWe could not believe the honesty.\\n\\nHe continued:\\n\\n> “This weekend, unfortunately, everyone actually showed up.”\\n\\nThe explanation angered us further. Hotels gamble with customer plans like gambling at casinos. People plan vacations around these bookings.\\n\\nDaniel offered a downgraded room—half the size, no sea view, and located directly above the loading dock. He said we would receive a small discount.\\n\\nWe rejected the offer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Emotional Impact**\\n\\nMy partner began crying in the lobby. Weeks of planning, savings, anticipation, and excitement destroyed in seconds. Other guests awkwardly watched the conversation unfold. It felt humiliating standing there while staff discussed our problem loudly.\\n\\nInstead of showing empathy, the employees seemed irritated that we refused to accept the downgrade. They acted as if we were the difficult ones.\\n\\nWe explained it was our tenth anniversary. We explained we took time off work, paid for gas, packed gifts, booked restaurant reservations, and built our entire weekend around this hotel.\\n\\nNone of this mattered to the staff.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Alternative Hotel Offer – Underwhelming Proposal**\\n\\nThe manager then tried to offer a room at a partner hotel thirty minutes away. It was described as “similar quality,” but quick online searches showed terrible reviews:\\n\\n* cockroach complaints\\n* mold problems\\n* outdated rooms\\n* rude staff\\n* unsafe neighborhood\\n\\nWe refused.\\n\\nThe manager insisted we should accept because they would cover taxi transfer. Instead of feeling reassured, we felt insulted. Taxi fare cannot replace experience value lost through mismanagement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Long Waiting Period**\\n\\nThe situation dragged on for nearly three hours.\\n\\nWe sat in the lobby, thirsty, tired, and hungry. No one offered:\\n\\n* complimentary drinks,\\n* temporary seating area,\\n* access to restrooms,\\n* or even a sincere apology.\\n\\nEvery fifteen minutes we approached the desk for updates, and each time the reply was:\\n\\n> “We are still checking availability.”\\n\\nIt became obvious they were hoping we would give up and leave quietly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Other Guests Also Affected**\\n\\nDuring our waiting period, we overheard multiple guests struggling with similar problems:\\n\\n* One family of five was told their two connecting rooms were not available.\\n* A business traveler complained about receiving a standard room instead of a suite.\\n* A woman from Germany argued loudly with her husband after discovering their room type was changed.\\n\\nClearly, overbooking wasn’t a rare problem—it was widespread.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Financial Distress**\\n\\nWe asked about refund options.\\n\\nThe hotel informed us that refunds may take seven to ten business days because credit card processors “take time.” They expected us to pay for another hotel out of pocket in the meantime.\\n\\nSo not only were we without a room,\\nwe would also be temporarily out hundreds of dollars.\\n\\nThis was unacceptable.\\n\\nWe demanded immediate refund processing or a printed statement confirming full financial return. It took another hour to get that document.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Communication Breakdown**\\n\\nThroughout the process, staff members:\\n\\n* contradicted each other,\\n* misinformed us,\\n* lost paperwork,\\n* switched shifts,\\n* forgot our names,\\n* and repeated the same apology script.\\n\\nThe hotel clearly lacked a system for handling overbooking, even though they knowingly caused these situations themselves.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Insincere Compensation Offer**\\n\\nEventually, they offered:\\n\\n* free breakfast vouchers,\\n* small refund percentage,\\n* and future discounts.\\n\\nBut why would we ever return to a hotel that ruined such an important weekend?\\n\\nThe compensation was meaningless.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Guest Perspective: Betrayal of Trust**\\n\\nHotel booking confirmation is supposed to provide security and peace of mind. Once a customer receives written booking approval, they should not worry about their room disappearing.\\n\\nThe hotel betrayed our trust.\\n\\nWe selected this hotel because of its positive reputation, high price, and promises of luxury. Instead, we spent our anniversary evening:\\n\\n* arguing with hotel staff,\\n* driving around looking for last-minute rooms,\\n* cancelling restaurant reservations,\\n* and dealing with emotional exhaustion.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Final Resolution**\\n\\nAfter nearly four hours of frustration, the hotel finally admitted defeat:\\n\\n> “We have no rooms left in our property. We recommend you search elsewhere.”\\n\\nThey insisted on calling a taxi, even though we drove our own car.\\n\\nWe packed our luggage back into the trunk, left the parking lot, and began calling alternative accommodations.\\n\\nMost hotels in the area were also full. It was a major holiday weekend.\\n\\nAt nearly midnight, we found a two-star motel ten miles away. The room was tiny and smelled like cigarettes, but we were desperate to sleep.\\n\\nWe spent the night holding hands, trying not to cry.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Next Morning Reflection**\\n\\nWe sat in silence eating vending machine snacks. The weekend had lost all meaning.\\n\\nWe discussed how hotels routinely treat overbooking like a harmless inconvenience, yet for guests, it can destroy once-in-a-lifetime moments.\\n\\nThis was not just an operational error—this was emotional harm.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Recommendations for Hotels**\\n\\nHotels must:\\n\\n1. Stop knowingly selling unavailable rooms.\\n2. Offer guaranteed relocation to equivalent hotel quality.\\n3. Provide same-day refund processing.\\n4. Train staff in empathy and crisis handling.\\n5. Communicate issues before arrival, not at the desk.\\n6. Maintain accurate digital inventory.\\n7. Ensure managers remain accessible.\\n\\nWithout these steps, overbooking will continue to damage thousands of travelers every year.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Closing Narrative**\\n\\nOverbooking may seem like a harmless business decision, but to real people, it’s devastating.\\n\\nWe arrived full of joy and left full of disappointment. We lost time, effort, money, energy, and emotional peace.\\n\\nWorst of all, an anniversary weekend we planned for months became a memory of stress and sadness.\\n\\nThe hotel ruined our celebration—not because of unavoidable circumstances, but because of greedy, careless, profit-driven decisions.\\n\\nWe will never forget this experience, and we will warn others not to trust hotels that protect revenue before they protect people.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**End of file — approx. 1,250 words**\\n\\n---\\n\\n'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\refund_policy.txt'}, page_content='\\n\\nThis document explains the refund policy followed in hotel management operations. It outlines the rules, conditions, timelines, and responsibilities related to refunds for room bookings, services, and other hotel charges. A clear refund policy helps hotels maintain transparency, reduce disputes, and build trust with guests.\\n\\nA refund refers to the return of money paid by a guest for a reservation or service that is canceled, modified, or not utilized. Refund policies vary based on hotel category, booking channel, seasonality, and promotional terms. Hotels must clearly communicate their refund policy at the time of booking.\\n\\nRefund policies generally depend on the type of reservation. Fully refundable bookings allow guests to cancel within a specified time frame and receive a full refund. Partially refundable bookings may involve deductions such as cancellation charges or service fees. Non-refundable bookings do not allow refunds under normal circumstances and are usually offered at discounted rates.\\n\\nCancellation timelines play a crucial role in refund eligibility. Most hotels specify a free cancellation window, such as 24, 48, or 72 hours before the check-in date. If a guest cancels within this window, they are eligible for a full or partial refund. Cancellations made after the cutoff time may attract penalties or result in no refund.\\n\\nRefund policies also differ for peak seasons and special events. During high-demand periods such as holidays, festivals, conferences, or weddings, hotels often enforce stricter refund rules. In such cases, bookings may be non-refundable or refundable only up to a limited date.\\n\\nAdvance bookings and group reservations follow separate refund guidelines. Group bookings usually require advance payments or deposits. These deposits may be partially refundable or non-refundable depending on the contract terms. Hotels clearly define refund clauses in group booking agreements to avoid conflicts.\\n\\nRefunds related to no-show cases are generally not permitted. A no-show occurs when a guest fails to arrive on the scheduled check-in date without prior cancellation. In most hotels, the full booking amount or at least one night’s charge is retained, and no refund is provided.\\n\\nEarly check-out situations may or may not qualify for refunds. If a guest leaves before the scheduled check-out date, the refund depends on hotel policy. Some hotels allow partial refunds if informed in advance, while others charge for the entire booked duration.\\n\\nRefunds for hotel services such as food and beverage, spa, laundry, or transportation are handled separately. If a service has already been consumed, refunds are usually not allowed. For prepaid but unused services, refunds may be processed after verification.\\n\\nIn cases of overbooking or hotel-initiated cancellations, guests are entitled to a full refund. Additionally, hotels may offer compensation such as alternative accommodation, meal vouchers, or discounts for future stays. These measures help maintain guest satisfaction.\\n\\nRefund policies must also address payment methods. Refunds are typically processed using the original mode of payment. For credit or debit card payments, refunds may take 7 to 14 business days depending on the bank. Cash refunds, if allowed, are processed at the front desk after verification.\\n\\nOnline travel agencies (OTAs) follow their own refund rules. When a booking is made through an OTA, the hotel must adhere to the refund policy agreed with the platform. Guests are usually required to initiate refund requests through the OTA rather than directly with the hotel.\\n\\nForce majeure situations such as natural disasters, pandemics, government restrictions, or travel bans may require special refund considerations. During such events, hotels may offer full refunds, partial refunds, or booking credits for future use, depending on management decisions and legal requirements.\\n\\nRefund approval procedures involve multiple departments. The front office verifies booking details, the accounts department processes the refund, and management approves exceptions. Proper documentation is essential for audit and compliance purposes.\\n\\nClear communication of refund policies is a key responsibility of hotel management. Policies should be displayed on the hotel website, booking confirmation emails, and at the front desk. Staff should be trained to explain refund terms politely and accurately.\\n\\nA well-defined refund policy protects both the hotel and the guest. It reduces misunderstandings, ensures consistent handling of cancellations, and supports professional hotel operations. Hotels should regularly review and update their refund policies to align with business goals and customer expectations.\\n\\nEnd of document.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\shuttle_timings.txt'}, page_content='\\n\\nShuttle transportation services are essential for hotels, corporate offices, universities, hospitals, and public travel hubs. In this document, you will find information about how shuttle timings are planned, communicated, monitored, and adjusted. The purpose of this text is to serve as training data for retrieval systems, embedding pipelines, and vector database testing. Although the details describe realistic shuttle operations, this file is designed only for experimental use and sample document indexing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 1 – INTRODUCTION TO SHUTTLES**\\n\\nShuttles are small to medium-sized passenger vehicles that operate repeatedly between two or more points, following pre-planned schedules. A shuttle may transport guests from a hotel to an airport, students from housing centers to universities, employees from parking lots to office buildings, or travelers from train stations to specific hotels.\\n\\nThe biggest reason organizations use shuttle systems is convenience. Passengers do not need to book rides, hail taxis, or calculate travel costs. Shuttles follow fixed timetables, making transportation predictable and stress-free.\\n\\nIn this sample document, shuttle timing information is discussed in depth so that retrieval models can pull useful answers based on embeddings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 2 – BASIC SHUTTLE TIMING STRUCTURE**\\n\\nShuttles operate in cycles. A cycle includes departure, travel time, stop duration, and return. When organizations set up timetables, they evaluate distance, weather patterns, traffic flow, peak usage hours, and staffing limitations.\\n\\nA typical daily schedule may look like this:\\n\\n* First shuttle departure: 5:00 AM\\n* Peak frequency: every 15 minutes\\n* Midday frequency: every 30 minutes\\n* Late-night service: once per hour\\n\\nMany travelers rely on precise timing to catch flights, attend meetings, or check into hotels. Mistimed service leads to frustration, negative reviews, and financial loss.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 3 – MORNING OPERATIONS (5:00 AM – 9:00 AM)**\\n\\nMorning shuttle timing is crucial because demand spikes. Travelers catching early flights must reach airports before security lines grow long. Employees are commuting to work. Students are arriving for first classes.\\n\\nA well-structured morning timetable may resemble:\\n\\n5:00 AM\\n5:15 AM\\n5:30 AM\\n5:45 AM\\n6:00 AM\\n6:15 AM\\n6:30 AM\\n6:45 AM\\n7:00 AM\\n7:15 AM\\n7:30 AM\\n7:45 AM\\n8:00 AM\\n8:15 AM\\n8:30 AM\\n8:45 AM\\n9:00 AM\\n\\nThis level of frequency requires additional staffing and more operational vehicles.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 4 – MIDDAY OPERATIONS (9:00 AM – 4:00 PM)**\\n\\nDuring midday hours, shuttle usage typically drops. Many travelers are already checked into hotels or offices.\\n\\nMidday frequency may change to every 30 minutes:\\n\\n9:00 AM\\n9:30 AM\\n10:00 AM\\n10:30 AM\\n11:00 AM\\n11:30 AM\\n12:00 PM\\n12:30 PM\\n1:00 PM\\n1:30 PM\\n2:00 PM\\n2:30 PM\\n3:00 PM\\n3:30 PM\\n4:00 PM\\n\\nThough passengers are fewer, consistency remains vital. Visitors still require reliable schedules.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 5 – EVENING OPERATIONS (4:00 PM – 9:00 PM)**\\n\\nEvening shuttle services grow busy again. Travelers return from daily activities, work shifts end, and students return to dormitories.\\n\\nEvening shuttles might run every 20 minutes:\\n\\n4:00 PM\\n4:20 PM\\n4:40 PM\\n5:00 PM\\n5:20 PM\\n5:40 PM\\n6:00 PM\\n6:20 PM\\n6:40 PM\\n7:00 PM\\n7:20 PM\\n7:40 PM\\n8:00 PM\\n8:20 PM\\n8:40 PM\\n9:00 PM\\n\\nThis evening wave is vital for customer satisfaction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 6 – LATE NIGHT OPERATIONS (9:00 PM – 2:00 AM)**\\n\\nLate-night shuttle timing changes drastically. Passenger volume is low, and maintenance crews prepare vehicles for the next day.\\n\\nMany services switch to hourly timing:\\n\\n9:00 PM\\n10:00 PM\\n11:00 PM\\n12:00 AM\\n1:00 AM\\n2:00 AM\\n\\nThis schedule saves fuel and reduces labor costs. However, passengers should be warned ahead of time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 7 – BENEFITS OF CONSISTENT SHUTTLE TIMING**\\n\\nA fixed shuttle timetable helps travelers manage expectations. It also supports route planning and operational efficiency. Benefits include:\\n\\n* Reduced wait times\\n* Increased reliability\\n* Clear communication\\n* Better user experience\\n* Lower stress\\n* Cost savings\\n* Predictable staffing needs\\n\\nOrganizations with frequent shuttle service appear professional and prepared.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 8 – FACTORS THAT AFFECT SHUTTLE TIMINGS**\\n\\nShuttle schedules are not static. They change because of real-world conditions:\\n\\n### Traffic Congestion\\n\\nRush-hour delays require timetable adjustments.\\n\\n### Weather\\n\\nRain, snow, storms, and fog slow vehicles down.\\n\\n### Driver Availability\\n\\nUnexpected sick leave disrupts timing.\\n\\n### Vehicle Capacity\\n\\nOverloaded shuttles cause passenger delays.\\n\\n### Airport or University Events\\n\\nSporting events, graduations, and conferences require temporary schedule increases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 9 – COMMUNICATION METHODS FOR TIMING UPDATES**\\n\\nPassengers must receive clear timing notifications. Common tools include:\\n\\n* Printed cards\\n* Electronic display boards\\n* SMS alerts\\n* Shuttle hotline\\n* Mobile applications\\n* Hotel front desk updates\\n* Email reminders\\n\\nCommunication failures frustrate travelers more than timing delays.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 10 – SHUTTLE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY**\\n\\nModern organizations use real-time shuttle tracking to improve accuracy. GPS tools reveal shuttle location, speed, estimated arrival time, and passenger load.\\n\\nShuttle location apps increase passenger trust.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 11 – WEEKEND & HOLIDAY TIMETABLES**\\n\\nWeekend shuttle timing differs from weekday timing. Every location has unique patterns:\\n\\n### Hotels\\n\\nWeekends require morning airport service.\\n\\n### Universities\\n\\nWeekend service is usually reduced.\\n\\n### Corporate Offices\\n\\nWeekend shuttles may not operate at all.\\n\\nSeasonal holidays also cause unpredictable passenger volume.\\n\\nExamples of holiday timing changes:\\n\\n* New Year’s extended hours\\n* Christmas day reduced hours\\n* Major event weekends with 24/7 service\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 12 – SHUTTLE CAPACITY MANAGEMENT**\\n\\nTiming alone does not guarantee smooth operation. Passenger capacity must be considered:\\n\\n* 12-seat vans\\n* 20-seat minibuses\\n* 40-seat buses\\n\\nIf demand exceeds supply, delays occur.\\n\\nPeak hours require multiple vehicles running parallel.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 13 – SHUTTLE STOP GUIDELINES**\\n\\nStop position affects timing accuracy. Rules include:\\n\\n* no parking blocking traffic\\n* avoid long boarding times\\n* assist passengers quickly\\n* maintain safety\\n\\nPassengers must know exact pickup points, not vague descriptions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 14 – MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES**\\n\\nMaintenance ensures shuttles run on time. Every day vehicles must be checked:\\n\\n* tire pressure\\n* oil level\\n* engine temperature\\n* brake strength\\n* lighting system\\n* mirror positioning\\n* seatbelts\\n\\nMaintenance time slots are usually scheduled at night.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 15 – DRIVER SHIFT TIMING**\\n\\nDrivers follow regulated working hours:\\n\\n* maximum shift length\\n* mandatory breaks\\n* rest time requirement\\n\\nTherefore, shuttle timetables must synchronize with legal labor restrictions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 16 – COST IMPACT OF TIMINGS**\\n\\nFrequent service increases fuel cost, labor expense, and mechanical wear.\\n\\nOrganizations must balance:\\n\\n* budget\\n* passenger demand\\n* operational safety\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 17 – SAMPLE TIMETABLE TABLE**\\n\\nBelow is a sample arrival/departure table:\\n\\n| TIME    | LOCATION         |\\n| ------- | ---------------- |\\n| 6:00 AM | Airport Terminal |\\n| 6:15 AM | Hotel Lobby      |\\n| 6:30 AM | Airport Terminal |\\n| 6:45 AM | Hotel Lobby      |\\n\\nThis format helps retrieval tools extract structured details.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 18 – IMPORTANCE FOR MACHINE LEARNING TESTING**\\n\\nThis document structure benefits RAG & vector search testing:\\n\\n* predictable sentence structure\\n* repeated patterns\\n* real-world terminology\\n* multi-section layout\\n* metadata simulation\\n\\nQueries you can test:\\n\\n* “When does shuttle frequency increase?”\\n* “Why do shuttles run hourly at night?”\\n* “How is maintenance scheduled?”\\n\\nThe retrieval model should identify exact sections.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 19 – FUTURE TECHNOLOGY**\\n\\nUpcoming innovations include:\\n\\n* autonomous shuttles\\n* electric shuttle fleets\\n* AI-based route prediction\\n* solar charging stations\\n* automated maintenance alerts\\n\\nThese developments will further optimize timing and reduce human error.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 20 – CONCLUSION**\\n\\nShuttle timings play an important role in transportation management. A precise timetable increases passenger confidence, enhances mobility, and reduces stress.\\n\\nThis document intentionally includes detailed timing analysis, repeat patterns, and realistic operational information.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\staff_misconduct.txt'}, page_content=' \\n\\nThis document describes a fictional scenario involving repeated misconduct by hotel staff members. The intention is to produce a long, realistic narrative suitable for natural language processing, retrieval evaluations, and document similarity testing. Nothing in this file references real people or real locations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Introduction**\\n\\nHotel staff members are expected to create an environment of comfort, safety, and professionalism. Guests trust employees with private information, personal belongings, and emotional wellbeing. When this trust is violated, the consequences can be severe.\\n\\nThe following text outlines one such situation. It describes how a family visiting Coastal View Hotel experienced three days of distress because multiple employees behaved inappropriately, unethically, and disrespectfully. Their experience ultimately resulted in a formal complaint, legal inquiry, and an online review that damaged the hotel’s reputation. The narrative is intentionally detailed to provide rich nuance for machine learning tasks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Arrival and First Warning Signs**\\n\\nThe family arrived at Coastal View Hotel late in the afternoon following a long flight. They expected courtesy and professionalism as advertised. Instead, the front desk clerk, whose nametag said “Gary,” greeted them with visible irritation.\\n\\nHe rolled his eyes when the guests asked routine questions about parking and luggage handling. His tone was sarcastic when explaining hotel facilities. When asked about breakfast hours, he replied,\\n\\n> “It’s written on the wall if you’d actually look.”\\n\\nThis unprofessional behavior created tension before the family even received their room keys.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Rude and Discriminatory Behavior**\\n\\nAs the family prepared to check in, Gary made personal remarks about their accents and clothing. He laughed under his breath and whispered to a coworker while staring at them. It was clear the comments were about the guests, yet he denied it when confronted.\\n\\nThis behavior crossed beyond rudeness into harassment.\\n\\nWhen the father asked if larger pillows were available for their elderly mother, Gary replied,\\n\\n> “Maybe you should book a hospital, not a hotel.”\\n\\nThe guests stood in shock. They wondered how someone with customer-facing responsibilities could act so unreasonably.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Luggage Damage and Staff Denial**\\n\\nLater that evening, another employee, a bellhop named Victor, arrived to assist with luggage delivery. During transport, he dropped one of the suitcases down the stairwell—not once, but twice.\\n\\nWhen the guests expressed concern, he laughed, saying:\\n\\n> “Relax, insurance covers it.”\\n\\nHowever, when they checked the bag, its side panel was cracked. Victor denied causing the damage and accused the guests of lying.\\n\\nThey reported this to management, but the supervisor insisted, without any investigation, that their staff “would never behave like that.”\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Security Incident in the Corridor**\\n\\nThat night, as the family returned from dinner, they noticed Victor and another employee whispering in the hallway outside their room.\\n\\nUpon seeing the family approach, the employees abruptly stopped talking and hurried away.\\n\\nA few hours later, the guests discovered signs someone had tried to enter their room. The lock showed scratches, and the security latch looked bent. They reported the issue, but security dismissed it as “typical wear and tear.”\\n\\nThe family was terrified at the possibility that staff members attempted unauthorized entry.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Unprofessional Housekeeping Practices**\\n\\nOn the second day, housekeeping entered the room without knocking, despite the “Do Not Disturb” sign displayed on the door.\\n\\nTwo housekeepers walked in while the grandmother was resting. They appeared surprised but unfazed.\\n\\nThe family asked if they could return in an hour, but the cleaners responded aggressively:\\n\\n> “We have schedules to follow. If you don’t like it, clean your own room.”\\n\\nSuch disrespect stunned the family.\\n\\nLater, they inspected the housekeeping work and noticed:\\n\\n* used towels left on the balcony railing,\\n* hair on bathroom tiles,\\n* missing toiletries,\\n* and broken glass under the dresser.\\n\\nThe hotel refused to assign new cleaners.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Staff Intoxication in Public Areas**\\n\\nThat evening, the family visited the bar for refreshments. While seated, they recognized Gary, the rude receptionist, drinking alcohol behind the counter with two coworkers.\\n\\nThey were laughing loudly, stumbling, and using foul language within guest earshot. When asked if the bar was still open, Gary sarcastically replied,\\n\\n> “Yeah, but not for annoying people.”\\n\\nThis was deeply unprofessional.\\n\\nOne staff member, clearly intoxicated, dropped multiple glass bottles. Instead of cleaning up the mess, he left the shards scattered across the bar floor, endangering guests walking nearby.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Room Service Theft and Accusations**\\n\\nOn the third evening, the family ordered room service. The food was delivered, but the server lingered inside the room unusually long, asking personal questions about electronics and valuables.\\n\\nLater, the family realized a digital camera was missing. They reported the theft.\\n\\nThe hotel responded by accusing the family of staging the incident for a free stay. No internal investigation was conducted.\\n\\nThe police eventually became involved, and officers discovered that the accused server had previous complaints filed against him at other hotels. Still, the Coastal View manager defended the employee, saying:\\n\\n> “He is loyal. We trust him more than random tourists.”\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Staff Gossip and Public Humiliation**\\n\\nAs the situation escalated, hotel employees openly whispered about the family. When the grandmother walked through the lobby, she heard two staff members say:\\n\\n> “Watch out, here comes the troublemakers.”\\n\\nSuch humiliation caused emotional harm.\\n\\nAt breakfast, one waiter intentionally ignored them for nearly forty minutes. Meanwhile, other tables received fast service.\\n\\nWhen they asked for assistance, the waiter responded:\\n\\n> “You people cause too many problems.”\\n\\nIt became clear staff were retaliating against the family for complaining.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Failure to Contact Management**\\n\\nThroughout their stay, the guests repeatedly asked to speak with the hotel manager.\\n\\nEach time, receptionists insisted:\\n\\n* “The manager is busy,”\\n* “He stepped out,”\\n* or “He does not speak to guests directly.”\\n\\nThe family left multiple written notes and emails, but none were answered.\\n\\nFinally, they learned from another guest that the manager was present every day—just choosing not to engage.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Guest Safety Risks**\\n\\nOn the final night, a physical confrontation occurred. When the father refused to sign a room service charge he did not authorize, a staff member threatened him.\\n\\nThe employee leaned close and said:\\n\\n> “If you don’t pay, we will make your stay much worse.”\\n\\nSecurity guards also sided with staff without reviewing evidence.\\n\\nThe father feared for his family’s safety. They stayed locked in their room until checkout.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Departure and Aftermath**\\n\\nOn checkout day, no apology was offered. Instead, Gary printed the bill while whistling smugly and asked:\\n\\n> “Enjoy your lovely stay?”\\n\\nThe family left in distress.\\n\\nThey documented every detail of their experience and submitted:\\n\\n* a formal complaint to regional tourism authorities,\\n* a report to hotel ownership,\\n* and a strongly worded online review.\\n\\nMany other guests later came forward describing similar misconduct:\\n\\n* intoxicated employees,\\n* stolen items,\\n* verbal insults,\\n* room privacy violations,\\n* and threatening behavior.\\n\\nManagement allegedly ignored most complaints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Impact on Hotel Reputation**\\n\\nOnce public, the misconduct allegations spread quickly across travel websites.\\n\\nThe hotel’s online rating dropped dramatically.\\n\\nNew visitors cancelled reservations, citing safety concerns.\\n\\nTourism bloggers highlighted the case as an example of poor employee screening and toxic workplace culture.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nThis fictional report shows how deeply harmful staff misconduct can become when a hotel lacks accountability, training, and proper supervision.\\n\\nProfessionalism is not optional in hospitality. Guests deserve respect, privacy, and fair treatment.\\n\\nThis document provides rich semantic variety for:\\n\\n* sentiment analysis,\\n* retrieval tests,\\n* topic classification,\\n* summary training,\\n* and similarity search.\\n\\nThe events described demonstrate emotional nuance, human conflict, operational flaws, and ethical issues—making it suitable for real–world retrieval evaluation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Approx. 1,250+ words.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'E:\\\\RAGexpHMS\\\\data\\\\text_files\\\\swimming_pool.txt'}, page_content='\\n\\nSwimming pools are popular recreational facilities found in hotels, sports clubs, community centers, universities, resorts, parks, and private homes. They provide physical exercise, social interaction, rehabilitation therapy, and stress relief. This document is intentionally long and structured to support vector databases, embedding tests, retrieval scenarios, question answering, and document chunking. While it describes realistic pool management operations, it is designed for testing only.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 1 – INTRODUCTION TO SWIMMING POOLS**\\n\\nA swimming pool is a controlled body of water designed for human recreation, training, and competitive use. Pools vary greatly in size, shape, depth, heating type, construction material, and purpose.\\n\\nGeneral types include:\\n\\n* Olympic pools\\n* lap pools\\n* hotel pools\\n* resort pools\\n* therapeutic pools\\n* diving pools\\n* children’s play pools\\n* infinity pools\\n\\nThe essence of pool management lies in maintaining water quality, ensuring guest safety, and managing daily usage schedules.\\n\\nSwimming pools require constant water filtration, chemical balancing, cleaning routines, and supervision. Unlike lakes or oceans, pools are artificially sustained systems; without proper management, water becomes unsafe within days.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 2 – POOL OPERATING HOURS & TIMINGS**\\n\\nSwimming pool operating schedules depend on purpose and facility policy. A hotel pool may open early morning and close late at night, while a community center pool may follow strict session-based hours.\\n\\nSample daily schedule:\\n\\n* 6:00 AM – Pool opens\\n* 6:00–8:00 AM Lap swim\\n* 8:00–10:00 AM Family swim\\n* 10:00 AM–12:00 PM Adult swim\\n* 12:00–4:00 PM Free swim\\n* 4:00–6:00 PM Kids training program\\n* 6:00–8:00 PM Fitness classes\\n* 9:00 PM – Pool closes\\n\\nScheduling must align with staffing availability, cleaning breaks, and maintenance blocks. Lifeguards require rest times, and chemical adjustments sometimes pause usage.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 3 – WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT**\\n\\nPool water must remain clear, disinfected, and chemically balanced.\\n\\n### Key chemistry components:\\n\\n1. **Chlorine** – disinfects bacteria\\n2. **pH level** – controls acidity/alkalinity\\n3. **Alkalinity** – stabilizes pH\\n4. **Calcium hardness** – protects pool surfaces\\n5. **Cyanuric acid** – shields chlorine from sunlight\\n\\nIdeal pH values remain between 7.2 and 7.8.\\n\\nA modern pool may use:\\n\\n* saltwater systems\\n* UV purification\\n* ozonation\\n* electronic monitoring sensors\\n\\nFailure in chemical balance leads to algae growth, cloudy water, strong odors, red eyes, and skin irritation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 4 – FILTRATION SYSTEMS & WATER CIRCULATION**\\n\\nWater cannot remain stagnant. Pool systems filter and rotate thousands of liters every day.\\n\\nCommon filtration systems:\\n\\n* sand filters\\n* cartridge filters\\n* diatomaceous earth filters\\n\\nCirculation pumps push water through filters and return clean water to the pool.\\n\\nMost facilities run filters 8–24 hours daily depending on occupancy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 5 – POOL SAFETY EQUIPMENT & SIGNAGE**\\n\\nSafety signage prevents injuries. Typical pool signs include:\\n\\n* “No Diving”\\n* “Shower Before Entering”\\n* “Children Must Be Supervised”\\n* “Slippery Surface”\\n* “Deep End”\\n* “No Running”\\n\\nEquipment required on-site:\\n\\n* rescue tubes\\n* floatation rings\\n* spinal boards\\n* whistles\\n* first aid kits\\n* automated external defibrillators\\n* emergency phone access\\n\\nLifeguards must watch continuously; distractions are dangerous.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 6 – LIFEGUARDS & STAFF TRAINING**\\n\\nHuman supervision is the heart of safety. Lifeguards must:\\n\\n* hold valid certification\\n* complete CPR training\\n* pass swimming skills tests\\n* maintain strong alertness\\n\\nShifts are structured to avoid fatigue. Long shifts reduce reaction time and visual scanning accuracy.\\n\\nStaff must practice emergency drills every month.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 7 – GUEST BEHAVIOR RULES**\\n\\nPool rules shape guest behavior and reduce accidents.\\n\\nCommon rules include:\\n\\n* no glass bottles\\n* no running\\n* no loud rough play\\n* no food in water\\n* proper swim attire required\\n* shower before entering\\n* children under 12 must be supervised\\n\\nHotels often require keycard access to prevent unsupervised entry.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 8 – CLEANING SCHEDULES**\\n\\nPool areas accumulate sunscreen residue, body oils, hair, leaves, dirt, insects, and cosmetics. Cleaning routines include:\\n\\n* skimming floating debris\\n* vacuuming pool floor\\n* brushing pool walls\\n* cleaning tiles\\n* emptying filters\\n* pressure washing deck surfaces\\n* sanitizing showers & locker rooms\\n\\nDeep cleaning occurs weekly or biweekly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 9 – POOL TEMPERATURE REGULATION**\\n\\nTemperature comfort depends on pool purpose:\\n\\n* competitive pools: 25°C – 28°C\\n* recreational pools: 27°C – 30°C\\n* therapy pools: 33°C – 36°C\\n* children pools: slightly warmer\\n\\nHeating systems must conserve energy but maintain comfort. Sudden temperature swings create guest complaints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 10 – CHILDREN’S POOL SECTION**\\n\\nChildren’s pools are shallow and operate near constant supervision. They include splash fountains, slides, stepping rocks, and gradual slope entry ramps.\\n\\nSpecial care includes:\\n\\n* soft flooring\\n* warm temperature\\n* non-slip surfaces\\n* chlorine control for delicate skin\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 11 – ADULT & LAP SWIM LANES**\\n\\nLap swimmers require lane ropes, distance markers, clocks, and directional guides.\\n\\nDuring peak hours, lanes rotate between slow, medium, and fast swimmers.\\n\\nRAG queries may ask:\\n\\n* lane spacing rules\\n* timing schedules\\n* water depth usage\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 12 – ACCESSIBILITY & SPECIAL NEEDS SUPPORT**\\n\\nPool facilities must follow accessibility rules:\\n\\n* wheelchair ramps\\n* pool lifts\\n* accessible lockers\\n* railings\\n* tactile tiles\\n\\nStaff must know how to assist without injury.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 13 – EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURE**\\n\\nEmergencies include:\\n\\n* drowning\\n* spinal injury\\n* heart attack\\n* allergic reaction\\n* broken bones\\n* hyperventilation\\n* heatstroke\\n\\nResponse sequence:\\n\\n1. recognize problem\\n2. alert team\\n3. remove swimmer\\n4. begin rescue breathing or CPR\\n5. call emergency services\\n\\nDocumentation follows every incident.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 14 – LOCKER ROOMS & HYGIENE AREAS**\\n\\nSupporting areas matter as much as pool water quality. Locker rooms require:\\n\\n* disinfecting spray\\n* anti-slip flooring\\n* ventilation\\n* secure lockers\\n* accessible showers\\n\\nOdor control depends on ventilation and cleaning frequency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 15 – GUEST EXPERIENCE & CUSTOMER SERVICE**\\n\\nPool areas must provide:\\n\\n* towels\\n* lounge seating\\n* music control at safe levels\\n* drink service away from water\\n* umbrellas for shade\\n\\nCustomer satisfaction improves repeat visits.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 16 – MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN RESPONSIBILITIES**\\n\\nTechnicians ensure equipment keeps running. They check:\\n\\n* pump room valves\\n* chlorine feeders\\n* heater efficiency\\n* filter pressure\\n* motor bearings\\n* timer programming\\n\\nFailure leads to expensive downtime.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 17 – POOL DESIGN & STRUCTURE**\\n\\nModern pools integrate:\\n\\n* LED lighting\\n* underwater speakers\\n* waterfall features\\n* ceramic tile finishes\\n* curved edges\\n* infinity visual lines\\n\\nRetrieval queries may extract design-related answers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 18 – OUTDOOR VS INDOOR POOLS**\\n\\nOutdoor pools face:\\n\\n* leaves\\n* pollen\\n* animal contamination\\n* solar heating shifts\\n\\nIndoor pools require:\\n\\n* humidity control\\n* HVAC circulation\\n* mold prevention\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 19 – COMMON POOL PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS**\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n### algae growth\\n\\nsolution → shock treatment & brushing\\n\\n### cloudy water\\n\\nsolution → filtration & chemical rebalance\\n\\n### chlorine odor\\n\\nsolution → add chlorine (yes, paradoxically)\\n\\n### slippery tiles\\n\\nsolution → surface treatment\\n\\nThese issues are frequently requested in RAG demo queries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 20 – TESTING VALUE FOR VECTOR RAG MODELS**\\n\\nThis file includes:\\n\\n* clear sections\\n* repeated terminology\\n* deep concepts\\n* numerical details\\n* safety rule lists\\n* instructional language\\n\\nThese elements help test:\\n\\n* semantic search\\n* question answering\\n* embedding quality\\n* chunk comparison\\n\\nExample search prompts:\\n\\n* “What is correct pH range for pool water?”\\n* “Explain lap lane timing rules.”\\n* “How often is pool water filtered?”\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **SECTION 21 – CONCLUSION**\\n\\nSwimming pool operations represent a mix of engineering, chemistry, hospitality, risk management, and fitness service. Every decision—from chemical dosing to lane scheduling—affects guest experience and safety.\\n\\nThis document is intentionally long to support machine learning experimentation involving RAG pipelines, chunk-based retrieval, vector similarity scoring, metadata enrichment, storage testing, and evaluation.\\n')]"

As the first point of physical contact, the front desk sets the tone for \\nguest expectations, service standards, and professional hospitality delivery. This Front Desk Standard \\nOperating Procedure (SOP) document is designed to outline processes, service style guidelines, job \\nduties, workflows, communication standards, and escalation methods. The goal is to ensure \\nconsistent guest service quality across all shifts and to offer clarity to new employees. \\nFront desk operations rely on teamwork, technology, and communication patterns that align with the \\nhotel’s brand identity, guest satisfaction goals, and safety priorities. The document below is fictional \\nand intended for software testing, data embedding, and training in RAG systems. It provides text \\nvariation, terminology depth, operational instruction, and narrative clarity suitable for vector database \\ntesting and retrieval analysis. \\n \\nFront Desk Role & Purpose \\nThe primary purpose of the front desk is to welcome guests, support check-in and check-out \\noperations, respond to inquiries, complete financial transactions, provide concierge-style assistance, \\nmaintain security protocols, and represent the hotel’s culture. Front desk agents are the voice and \\nface of the establishment. \\nGuest perceptions are heavily influenced by their first interactions. A warm greeting, a confident \\nexplanation of hotel features, and a helpful attitude can dramatically improve satisfaction. \\nConversely, slow service, unclear communication, or unfriendly behavior may result in negative \\nreviews and guest frustration. \\n \\nPre-Shift Responsibilities \\nFront desk staff must begin their shift prepared and aware of all operational updates. Preparation \\nsteps include: \\n1. Reviewing the daily logbook for VIP arrivals, special requests, or operational notes. \\n2. Checking communication from previous shifts, including unresolved guest complaints. \\n3. Confirming system access credentials are working. \\n4. Ensuring workstation sanitation and front desk appearance meet standards. \\n5. Verifying office supplies such as forms, key cards, pens, and printer paper. \\n6. Reviewing the reservation forecast for occupancy alerts. \\n7. Cross-checking room availability with housekeeping status. \\nPrepared employees operate more efficiently and reduce operational delays during guest interaction.'),\n",

They must \\navoid working on other tasks while guests stand waiting. \\nIf the front desk is busy, agents should acknowledge guests immediately and politely request \\npatience: \\n“I will be with you shortly. Thank you for waiting. ” \\nNo guest should be ignored at any time. \\n \\nCheck-In Procedure \\nThe check-in process should be handled smoothly and respectfully. Standard steps include: \\n1.

The following content is fictional and created specifically for system training, \\ndevelopment testing, information retrieval projects, and hotel simulation models. \\nThis menu-style text is deliberately long, exceeding one thousand words, to support testing \\nenvironments requiring large text inputs. It contains dish descriptions, ordering instructions, allergy \\nnotes, service charges, and recommendations, which collectively simulate a realistic operational \\nmenu. \\n \\nMenu Overview \\nThe room service dining system is available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, offering \\nconvenience and comfort. Guests may order meals, snacks, desserts, or beverages directly from their \\nroom using the dedicated phone extension or a digital ordering platform if installed on television \\nsystems or tablets. All dishes listed here are customizable. The menu is divided into multiple \\ncategories: Breakfast, All-Day Dining, Sandwiches, Soups, Salads, International Dishes, Kids’ Meals, \\nDesserts, Beverages, and Late-Night Selections. \\nPresentation quality is important to the hotel philosophy: every meal must arrive freshly prepared, \\nproperly heated, organized neatly on trays, and accompanied by condiments, cutlery, and napkins. \\nGuest satisfaction strongly depends on menu clarity, taste consistency, and timely delivery. \\n \\nOrdering Guidelines \\nTo order room service, hotel guests can call extension 2222. A trained service agent will confirm their \\nroom number, dietary preferences, allergies, and delivery timing. Guests may request breakfast to be \\ndelivered at a specific hour, arrange table set-ups, or request celebrations such as birthday surprises. \\nThe average delivery time is between 25 and 40 minutes.

       " '---\\n\\n### **Overview**\\n\\nThis document contains a detailed fictional complaint account about a prolonged air-conditioning failure in Room 204 and the resulting consequences. The narrative describes guest interaction, technical issues, staff responses, and emotional impact. It is intentionally lengthy for RAG/document retrieval testing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Day 1 – Arrival Experience**',\n",
       " '---\\n\\n### **Day 1 – Arrival Experience**\\n\\nI checked into Room 204 on a hot summer afternoon at around 3:30 PM. The lobby temperature felt perfectly cool, so I assumed the guest rooms would be the same. However, when I opened the door to Room 204, a wave of warm, stuffy air hit my face. The room temperature felt well above 30°C (86°F). The air conditioning unit was already running, but it blew nothing except warm, humid air.',\n",
       " 'At first, I thought maybe the room simply needed time to cool down. I left my luggage by the bed, placed a bottle of water near the window, and unpacked slowly, waiting for the room to cool. After about an hour, I realized nothing was improving. In fact, the temperature seemed to increase. Sweat rolled down my back and neck, and the air felt thick, stale, and suffocating.',\n",
       " 'I checked the digital thermostat, which showed an error code: **E4 – low gas pressure/coil malfunction**. The AC made a rattling noise every few minutes, followed by a grinding vibration that shook the TV cabinet. Clearly something was wrong.\\n\\nI went downstairs to report the issue at reception. The staff member on duty, named Elena, seemed polite but overwhelmed. She confirmed that engineering staff were “very busy” and told me to wait “just a short while.”',\n",
       " 'After returning to my room, the heat was unbearable. My shirt was soaked, and the balcony door would not open properly. I called reception again an hour later, and Elena apologised but said the maintenance team had not yet reached my room. Before sleeping, I requested a different room, but the receptionist insisted the hotel was fully booked.',\n",
       " 'That first night was miserable. The heat made resting impossible. I tossed and turned, constantly wiping sweat off my forehead. The ceiling fan rattled loudly, offering little relief. By morning, I had barely slept an hour.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Day 2 – Broken Promises and Staff Miscommunication**',\n",
       " 'At 7:00 AM, I walked back to the front desk to repeat my complaint. A different staff member, Victor, acted surprised and said there was no record of my complaint the previous day, which made me frustrated. He told me he would “personally handle it” and asked me to wait in the room until a technician arrived.\\n\\nI skipped breakfast, afraid to miss the maintenance visit. No one arrived. At 11:00 AM, I called again, and reception claimed the technician would come “right after lunch.”',\n",
       " 'Afternoon arrived. Still no technician.\\n\\nAround 3:00 PM, I decided to visit guest relations in person. They told me the technician had gone to Room 304 by mistake, thinking that was the complaint room. They apologised and said someone was “on the way.”',\n",
       " 'Finally, at around 4:00 PM, a maintenance worker entered the room. He inspected the unit, removed the front panel, and immediately said, “This is bad. The internal compressor is overheated.” He turned off the unit completely and said it needed replacement. He estimated repairs would finish in one hour.\\n\\nI was relieved. Maybe I could finally cool down.\\n\\nHowever, the technician never returned.',\n",
       " 'However, the technician never returned.\\n\\nAt 6 PM, I went downstairs again, exhausted. The staff told me repairs were delayed and the technician had left for the day. They offered a small desk fan as compensation, which barely helped.\\n\\nAnother sleepless night followed. The temperature stayed dangerously high. The lack of ventilation made it even worse. I drank multiple bottles of water to avoid dehydration, but I still woke up dizzy and nauseous several times.',\n",
       " 'The AC unit continued to click, beep, and make random bursting sounds. I unplugged it, afraid it might catch fire.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Day 3 – Health Impact and Guest Anger**\\n\\nBy the morning of Day 3, frustration turned into anger. I walked downstairs again to demand resolution. I was sweating through my shirt just standing in the elevator.',\n",
       " 'I told the front desk I wanted to check out early due to extreme discomfort. Instead of apologizing, the employee frowned and said early checkout would incur full charges and penalties. It felt like the hotel cared more about money than guest welfare.\\n\\nI explained I had a headache, dry eyes, and dizziness from lack of sleep and heat exposure. No one offered medical help or even a bottle of water.',\n",
       " 'Around noon, the hotel manager finally spoke to me. He claimed the AC compressors across multiple rooms were failing and that engineers were working overtime. He offered me lunch vouchers and said he would “try” to find an empty room if one became available.\\n\\nAfter lunch, the situation worsened. The desk fan they gave me suddenly stopped working. My phone overheated when I tried charging it. Even water bottles stored in the room turned warm.',\n",
       " 'At 2:20 PM, I asked to visit Room 204 with a temperature scanner. The device showed **31.8°C (89.2°F)** inside the room—nearly outside safe sleeping levels.\\n\\nOther guests on the same floor complained loudly near the elevator. I heard someone yell that Room 206 and Room 209 had AC units that also failed. The hotel seemed to be experiencing a major cooling system crisis.',\n",
       " 'That night, I slept on a towel over the floor near the door for the slightly cooler air leaking through the hallway gap. I barely got any sleep at all.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Staff Attitude**\\n\\nThroughout the stay, what upset me most was not just the failed AC—it was the staff attitude and communication failure:',\n",
       " '1. Promises made, then ignored\\n2. Repair team lost or misdirected\\n3. No empathy\\n4. No urgency\\n5. No temporary room offered\\n6. Records not maintained correctly\\n7.

Partially refundable bookings may involve deductions such as cancellation charges or service fees. Non-refundable bookings do not allow refunds under normal circumstances and are usually offered at discounted rates.',\n",

       " 'Early check-out situations may or may not qualify for refunds. If a guest leaves before the scheduled check-out date, the refund depends on hotel policy. Some hotels allow partial refunds if informed in advance, while others charge for the entire booked duration.',\n",
       " 'Refunds for hotel services such as food and beverage, spa, laundry, or transportation are handled separately. If a service has already been consumed, refunds are usually not allowed. For prepaid but unused services, refunds may be processed after verification.',\n",
       " 'In cases of overbooking or hotel-initiated cancellations, guests are entitled to a full refund. Additionally, hotels may offer compensation such as alternative accommodation, meal vouchers, or discounts for future stays. These measures help maintain guest satisfaction.',\n",
       " 'Refund policies must also address payment methods. Refunds are typically processed using the original mode of payment. For credit or debit card payments, refunds may take 7 to 14 business days depending on the bank. Cash refunds, if allowed, are processed at the front desk after verification.',\n",
       " 'Online travel agencies (OTAs) follow their own refund rules. When a booking is made through an OTA, the hotel must adhere to the refund policy agreed with the platform. Guests are usually required to initiate refund requests through the OTA rather than directly with the hotel.',\n",
